# league-patcher-jsons
This repository is supposed to provide old and all current .json files used by the new bundle-based patcher.

Because the names of the manifests used by the new league of legends patcher consist of 16 hexadecimal digits, brute forcing them is impossible. And because of the lack of a versioning system, once an old .json file is replaced by a new version, it is no longer retrievable on riot's official servers.
However, (currently) the manifests and bundles for older versions stay available and can still be downloaded.

This repository should / will be automatically updated daily with the newest available json files.
