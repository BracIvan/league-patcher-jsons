https://ks-foundation.dyn.riotcdn.net/channels/public/releases/C1CEE1BFA8098D54.manifest has update.level 21

not sure what's up with the "secure" urls, they seem to be the same version as the non-secure ones, but have a different manifest id.
and their current version is lower than the highest non-secure one. idk

update.level: 59, Version: 1.9.0.2947676, Url: https://ks-foundation.secure.dyn.riotcdn.net/channels/public/releases/86AAC858BA578F92.manifest
