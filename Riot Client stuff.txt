https://ks-foundation.dyn.riotcdn.net/channels/public/releases/F7A7D3BF125A2AE2.manifest has update.level 28?

not sure what's up with the "secure" urls, they seem to be the same version as the non-secure ones, but have a different manifest id.
and their current version is lower than the highest non-secure one. idk
